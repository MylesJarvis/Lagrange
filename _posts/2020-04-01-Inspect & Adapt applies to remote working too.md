## *Government, along with the rest of the economy, has seen a huge, enforced, mindset shift. We're all learning how to make work, work.*

### Advice overload.

Yes, there are a plethora of companies that have worked remotely since their inception (Zapier, GitLab, Basecamp, Buffer, Ars Technica), and many have written guides on how to do this successfully ([Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/) and [their associated eBook](https://zapier.com/blog/free-remote-working-book-download/), [Miro](https://miro.com/guides/remote-work/), [Trello](https://info.trello.com/hubfs/How_To_Embrace_Remote_Work_Trello_Ultimate_Guide.pdf), [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/books/remote)). This success does not mean that a team can just read something and become a high-performing remote team.

As a member of a team that actively co-locates, and has done for some time, it's wholly unsurprising that the pace of our value delivery may well come up against some impediments. 

So what have we done to help?

### Clarify ways of working

Start at the start - it's important to understand your team's baseline. I ran a  whiteboard session with the full team to discuss their perspectives of remote working and how they would like it to work. Tools you can use here include [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/), [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com), [Skype even has a built in whiteboarding feature](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-whiteboard-to-collaborate-in-a-skype-for-business-meeting-bd3d1cad-83b0-4139-bd07-c45ce94c59e0).

I followed this structure:

- Individually: 3 minutes to write 3 findings from remote working so far, these could be positives, negatives, actions they'd like to see, anything so long as it has discussion value.
- Individually: 3 minutes to transfer 3 things onto the digital whiteboard.
- Group: 3 minutes to affinity sort these into groups.
- Group: As long as necessary to talk through each group of notes and generate actions.

Alongside positive discussion on the sheer volume of communication channels we had suddenly created, and the need to be flexible with each other, we generated the following, simple, actions:

- Making sure your status is updated on Slack, including an indicator of "typical" hours, subject to any changing requirements like childcare.
- Setting automatic replies on your emails, so that those writing to you with requests understand when you work, and when you are checking emails. 
- Add photos to all of your accounts across different tools. This makes it simple to know the right people are in the right meetings.

In short, setting an **expectation of availability** to people is key. These ideas may sound obvious, but until this moment, had not been visualised or communicated in the team to get to a joint understanding.

### Find your toolset

You will find that tools that were sparingly used in an office environment suddenly need to take centre stage. As a Delivery Manager, take stock of the approved platforms available to you to bring people together. Make notes of any limitations for each platform, such as attendee restrictions, as well as positive features.

Armed with this, go about clarifying with the team **how meetings and collaboration are going to happen**. This leads to less complexity and more engagement. 

Once you've agreed this, ensure that everyone understands when and where tools will be used, as well as any backups if there are technical difficulties.

### Have some fun

Without the organic interactions you will have from an office environment, it can be difficult to maintain the important team bonds that inevitably form from face-to-face conversation. 

This leaves a large gap in the normal fabric of office life that, as Delivery Manager, can be critical to fill. One of the eight stances of a Delivery Master ([as ably set out by Barry Overeem here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/8-stances-scrum-master) is that of a *Change Agent*, enabling a culture in which teams can flourish. 

#### Socialising

Alongside a focus on output-driven delivery, it is the role of the Delivery Manager to create that environment for socialising and general morale boosting. To this end, I have implemented:

- Friday "non-work" calls to round off the week;
- Midweek "second stand-up" to talk about non-work and non-news related things.

Bonus points for using video, where team members are comfortable doing so.

#### Through the Keyhole: Remote Working Edition

The premise is [similar to this call centre implementation](https://www.callcentrehelper.com/team-building-game-through-the-key-hole-78192.htm), but electronically. Staff take three pictures of their home, providing clues throughout, and give them to a central organiser. These are shared across the space of a day in a channel of your choice. Each person is asked to make a final guess after the three photos have been shared. Guessing and intel sharing in earlier rounds is allowed and encouraged.

It's helped build team spirit and improve our ability to have those critical, casual conversations the help grease the wheels of effective team functioning.  

### Conclusion

All of these measures amount to a **loose framework that enables people to be effective at, but also step away from, work**, avoiding falling into the trap of having to demonstrate an always on mentality that can easily develop when working in your own home.

Your mileage with these specific activities may vary but, regardless of your situation, they can be tools for a conversation with your team.

We're constantly inspecting and adapting in this new environment we find ourselves in, and you should too. 

Stick at it, keep talking, and you will move the needle in the right direction.
