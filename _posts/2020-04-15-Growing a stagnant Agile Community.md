I've observed Delivery Management Community meets within several departments that I have worked in. They all show striking similarities:

- The same people planning sessions;
- The same people leading sessions;
- The same people attending sessions.

How can you, as a Delivery Manager, solve this? 

Is it possible to make more people attend and learn, helping to build an organisational habit, with all the associated benefits of accelerating professional development, breaking down organisational silos and improving employee happiness and retention. Here I explore some of the steps I've taken, steps which may benefit you.

As a disclaimer, I've never worked in an organisation with a "perfect" Community.

## Set the tone

You should use a "kick-off" or "reboot" meeting to try and reignite the Community. Ensure every potential Community member knows about it and is able to attend if they can - without this, you will fail.

You will need to understand:

- People's motivations: why do they want to come to these?
- People's availability: when is the best time to enable most attendance?
- People's pain points: what normally stops them attending?

Maybe you've tried reboots before. People may feel like you're trying the same initiatives again and again, that's to be expected. However without this restart, the Community will continue to wither.

## A Community Backlog, democratically prioritised

You understand people's motivations, their availability, and what they're hoping to extract from a Delivery Manager Community. 

You can now help them co-create the content.

I recommend that you whiteboard these ideas with [a Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) style session. Everyone will write down things they want to learn and discuss at a Community meeting. Most importantly, they will be voted on by everyone. Document this on a site everyone can access - I've previously used Confluence. 

You now have a prioritised backlog that can sustain your meetings for the forseeable future.

With a transparent repository of sessions, use this to try and build commitment from "non-core" members. Ask them to run a session, volunteer to help organise, or perform assisting some role. This can go some way to helping break an expectant mentality of just turning up and having a "oven-ready" session.

## Community is not optional: using the Head of Role

All Delivery Manager job adverts within government *should* now state that sharing learning and expertise is a compulsory activity. Contractors are similarly obliged to upskill Civil Servants and increase in-house knowledge.

Making sure this is understood, and more importantly acted upon, is difficult. Getting the Head of Role for your department to present at the Community is one way of helping focus this idea. This session needs to set an expectation for staff.

On reflection, this feels more "stick" than "carrot". Most of your Community work should, quite rightly, be steeped in user need. The vision of your Head of Role may help to provide more "stickiness" to some attendees who are prone to dropping away over time.

## This way to a better Community: clear signposting

People need to know what's in it for them. What is the value proposition of this meeting? Do I know this ahead of time so I can make an informed judgement about the use of my time?

Ensure you send out calendar invites in good time. Include a short description of the session and learning objectives. 

This successfully answers the common objection of "How is spending my time in this way going to make me a better Delivery Manager?".

## Making it a habit

Ideally, the Community meets will be attended regularly by a health majority of the Community itself. The best chance of this happening is making attendance an organisational habit.

Atomic Habits, by James Clear, sets out an effective framework to build better habits. He splits the process into four. Make it **obvious**, make it **attractive**, make it **easy** and make it **satisfying**.

How can you apply this framework to a Community meetup?

- Make it obvious: Get an accurate invite list so everyone knows it happens. Your Delivery Practice can usually help here. If one doesn't exist, build one and ask colleagues to add omissions.
- Make it attractive: Present topics that people have expressed an interest in during your kick-off meeting.
- Make it easy: hold the event at the same time, in the same place, with the same regularity. Predictability reduces complexity.
- Make it satisfying: Present topics that are guaranteed to help people grow, giving them something to apply immediately in their work.

Using these steps can help change the default for an employee from staying at desks to attending sessions every time.

## Conclusion

Building a Community isn't easy, particularly if the enthusiasm isn't there. 

What I've written can help you. From framing the Community in the right way, to making sure people understand the obligations of their role, to democratically picking subjects to discuss.
